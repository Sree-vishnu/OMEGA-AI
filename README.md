# OMEGA-AI (Your personal AI with Disaster Risk Management, Security and Home Automation capabilities)
MITS Hackathon

Ever wondered living without manually turning on your switches and appliances. Omega-AI
renders intelligent control of your home or workplace without doing anything with several
other features. A home automation system with a conventional algorithm-based program, just
carries out actions based on a set of rules. They are incapable of improvising with a degree of
self-awareness and also in finding the actual intent to inaccurate programmed commands.
Omega-AI does that exact task by imparting self-awareness using advanced computer vision
and deep learning by neural networks. It is designed with the primary aim of efficient energy
management with intelligent computer vision capabilities using neural networks and a natural
language processing interface which can be used to control appliances, monitor and to receive
and set alerts for a variety of function
Omega AI does real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide and
seismic activity of rooms and hallways to facilitate the first-hand emergency measures in the
event of a disaster.

By using computer vision, a potential for a fire to become an imminent threat is
calculated based on the rate of growth of the fire and the occupants and rescue services are
alerted immediately thus eliminating a disaster even before it occurs.
During a disaster, based on the data logged from each room and hallways, the areas prone
to potential risk is found and the occupants are provided with the safest escape route using
LED wires. The entry for the rescue team is also highlighted during such events for quick entry
into the affected area.
A Web App based dashboard facilitates the real-time monitoring of areas. Rescue
services are directed to the people trapped in an area upon pressing an SOS button, which is
accessible to all the occupants of the building.
Omega AI App provides remote and quick accessibility to these functions.
